## Usage

This is my personal global `.gitignore`. Use it to your hearts content if you want. I mainly do Ruby, Go and JavaScript relted programming, so this might or might not suit your needs.

To use:

- Clone the repo 

```
git clone https://github.com/floriank/gitignore ~/.gitignore/
```

- Add the following line to your `~/.gitconfig`

```
[core]
        excludesfile = ~/.gitignore/.gitignore_global
```
